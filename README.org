#+title: Self hosting

* Chapter 2: Media server
- Media server or sharing the media
- Jellyfin
- Samba
- [[https://parottasalna.com/2024/09/02/the-search-for-the-perfect-media-server-a-journey-of-discovery/][Minidlna]]
** Rclone - dlna
- Download rclone from https://rclone.org/
- rclone can serve file/share(cloud files) these over SFTP, HTTP, WebDAV, FTP and DLNA.
  #+begin_src shell
    ./rclone serve dlna /home/goldayan/Songs
  #+end_src
- Now we can use VLC -> network tab to stream the audio/video
- VLC can automatically detect the dlna server (wait for few mins)
- VLC: can be installed in Mobile,TV

* Chapter 3: Sharing folders
** Webdav
- Download rclone from https://rclone.org/
- rclone can serve file/share(cloud files) these over SFTP, HTTP, WebDAV, FTP and DLNA.
  #+begin_src shell
    ./rclone serve dlna /home/goldayan/Songs
  #+end_src
** Samba
** NFS

* Chapter 5: Syncing folders between devices
** Rsync
#+begin_src shell
  rsync -avz --delete /path/to/local/folder/ user@remote_host:/path/to/remote/folder/
#+end_src

- ~-a~: Archive mode; it preserves permissions, timestamps, symbolic links, etc.
- ~-v~: Verbose; it provides detailed output of the transfer process.
- ~-z~: Compresses file data during the transfer for faster transmission.
- Note: Ensure the remote folder is already created.

** Syncthing
- To expose in local network
- `$HOME/.local/state/syncthing` then find port 8384
- Change 127.0.0.1:8384 to :8384 (colon is important) [I need to check once]

* Chapter 12: Monitoring services

** Service/App health monitor - status-ng

** System monitor - glances
- It is a python program so we will use pipx to install it.
  #+begin_src shell
    pipx install 'glances[all]'
  #+end_src
- To start the web server
  #+begin_src shell
    glances -w
  #+end_src
- This will start the web server in 61208 (atleast for me)  

* Chapter 13: Notification service
- [[file:english/ntfysh.md][Ntfy - Notification server]]

* Chapter 14: DNS and Ad-Blocking
- ref: https://comfy.guide/server/blocky/
- Check if 53 port is already used by other service (most typically systemd-resolved in ubuntu)
  #+begin_src shell
    sudo lsof -i :53
  #+end_src
- Check the status  
  #+begin_src shell
    sudo systemctl status systemd-resolved
  #+end_src
- disable (permanent)
  #+begin_src shell
    sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
  #+end_src
- stop  (temporary), turn on after reboot
  #+begin_src shell
    sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
  #+end_src

* Chapter 15: Rich Site Summary
** Yarr (Yet Another RSS Reader)
- Download the appropriate binary file from the following repo
  - https://github.com/nkanaev/yarr
- Start the server using
  #+begin_src shell
    ./yarr -addr ":7070"
  #+end_src
- By default yarr only listens on localhost, above command will make
  it to listen on all network devices.

** Read you - Android app
- Install the app from F-droid
- We can use **Fever** api to sync RSS from yarr to mobile
- Sample fever url will be
  - https://<DOMAINNAME:7070>/fever/
  - last / is important, otherwise it didn't work
- For username and password try admin
